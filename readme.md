A fairly basic wrapper around the awesome Trix Editor [https://trix-editor.org/](https://trix-editor.org/) to allow it to be used as a form type in Symfony.

Current things that are NOT implemented:

* File uploads
* Customising toolbars

This is something we use a lot in our internal projects so it assumes that you are running bootstrap 5 on some of the styling.... since that's what we do.
